> Demo branch intended for demonstration installations like [Quando demo](https://behold.metamotive.co.nz/quando). Use `develop` branch for a generic skeleton installation.

# Quando plugin demo site Grav skeleton

This [Grav CMS](https://getgrav.org) skeleton is just to demo a working [Quando plugin](https://github.com/hughbris/grav-plugin-quando) demo with minimal theme.

The demo is deployed at http://behold.metamotive.co.nz/quando if you just want to look there without playing with settings and templates.

## Installing

I'm going to assume you've successfully unpacked Grav and got it working on your webserver.

Clone the repository into your new Grav site, replacing Grav's default `user` directory. To check and install dependencies (theme, plugins), go to a command line in the Grav root and issue:

```sh
bin/grav install
```

## Contents

The skeleton's contents are:

* [Home/intro page](pages/01.home/default.md) with some handy explanations, tips and links
* [Demo page](pages/05.demo/opening.md), which is a page showing off features of the plugin in use in the context of a fictitious "Opening Hours" page
