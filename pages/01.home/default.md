This is the homepage of the skeleton that demos the [Quando Grav plugin](https://github.com/hughbris/grav-plugin-quando) to show opening hours.

You probably want to skip to the main demo showcase, the [opening hours page](/demo).

You can check out your own working skeleton to play with at [its Github repo](https://github.com/hughbris/grav-skeleton-quando). This skeleton won't be submitted to the Grav repos because it's basically just for demo purposes, not for rapid site establishment.

! Fun fact: the plugin was known as Opaque during its two-year private development and launched with that name for a very short time before being renamed for some reason. Only very sharp followers of my activity (nobody) will know this.
